They’re the world’s premier manufacturer and supplier of sharp edge metallic cutting products, and North America’s leading provider of commercial food equipment parts. While their reputation for high quality products is well established, the online KASCO customer experience did not reflect this. KASCO knew it was time to modernize their digital sales channel, but they needed an experienced team to guide them to the best solution."

The first challenge KASCO acknowledged was that they lacked the internal resources required to tackle this project in-house. They had a few key executives with e-commerce experience, but they didn’t have a department dedicated to digital commerce. It was critical for KASCO to choose an e-commerce partner that was more than a platform implementer – they had to be a strategic partner who could help KASCO articulate their full e-commerce vision and design with a solution that could evolve at the same pace as their business."

          "text": "The second challenge was choosing the right e-commerce platform. One that could scale with their growth, yet not be so complex that it required an internal staff of specialists. The e-commerce partner and platform needed to support KASCO as they evolved their online channel. Above all, the e-commerce platform had to align with their ongoing digital transformation built on D365 Finance and Operations led by KASCO’s Microsoft partner Covenant Technology Partners."

There was a great cultural fit between Evenica, KASCO and Covenant – and KASCO understood that Evenica would be a partner that was invested in their long term objectives. After an initial discovery, Evenica presented Microsoft D365 Commerce as a scalable solution that could be implemented precisely through Evenica’s highly refined Quick Start methodology. This option offered technology synergy between KASCO’s existing platforms – including Microsoft D365 Finance and Sales. This seamless integration provided flexibility, efficiencies and capabilities that other e-commerce platforms couldn’t provide."

One of the values in both of these projects is the openness, the transparency that we all have, as well as always have a sense of fun! This has got to be exciting, and I think it’s exciting for all of us! And that culture fit, I truly believe it builds long term partnerships. It allows partners like us to have an invested interest in the outcome.” – Jake Howard, IT Director at KASCO"
